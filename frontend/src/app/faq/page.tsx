          Please utilize the commenting system on your match so that you can
          update your group members about any issues. We hope your group can
          come to an agreement if this happens, for example, how long of a delay
          is too long for group members to wait for you. The delayed member can
          always opt in to the unmatched section to find others.

          We understand travelling can be unpredictable. If at all possible,
          please cancel your questionnaire form for your flight at least 3 days
          in advance of your flight. This way, you will not be affecting any
          group creations. <br></br>
          If that is not possible, then you can cancel, but keep in mind that
          this will affect the others assigned to your group.

          with your match, you can cancel. If you resend in a questionnaire and
          opt in to being in the unmatched section, you can find others who you
          may be able to split a ride with.

          groups! Browse through groups and individuals who are in the same boat
          as you. Send a join request if you find something that works for you!
          NOTE: this is only available if you opted in when you filled out your
          questionnaire for that flight.

          We are using a machine learning model to group all of our existing

          points, and other important details. Our model’s performance improves
          as our user base increases, so please spread the word about Pickup!
          Further, please submit feedback on matches so that we can improve our
          model in the future!

          We aim to keep our users as anonymous as possible. Once you’ve matched
          with a group, we provide the group members your first name and email.
          We do not share your flight info, last name, or phone number. Further,
          we do not share any personal info with people not in your group.

          learning model will try to find the optimal match for you! Our model’s
