# Supabase schema reference

Human-readable catalog of the `public` schema used by PICKUP. Column types match [`src/lib/database.types.ts`](../src/lib/database.types.ts) (generated from Supabase). Regenerate types after schema changes — full steps in [OPERATIONS.md](./OPERATIONS.md):

```bash
pnpm exec supabase gen types typescript --linked --schema public > src/lib/database.types.ts
```

Alternative if not linked: `--project-id <ref>` instead of `--linked`.

**Note:** `ChangeLog.change_batch_id` is used in the app but may be missing from an older `database.types.ts` export—confirm in the Supabase table editor.

**Group model:** A **ride group** is all `Matches` rows sharing the same `ride_id`. Each row is one rider’s membership and stores per-rider voucher/subsidy fields; pickup **date/time** on `Matches` are the group schedule shown to users (often aligned across members).

## `Rides`

Group-level header (date/time/voucher at ride granularity). The frontend mostly reads/writes **`Matches`**; we added extra columns here for the future if ride characteristics (time, type, voucher, etc.) should be moved to this table instead of in `Matches`. Currently, all this info is stored in `Matches` and the query logic follows that.

| Column | Type | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| `ride_id` | `bigint` | Primary key (same id used on `Matches.ride_id`) |
| `ride_date` | `date` | Group date |
| `ride_time` | `time` | Group time (unused) |
| `ride_type` | `text` | Category label for the ride (unused)|
| `subsidized` | `boolean` | Ride-level subsidy flag (unused)|
| `voucher` | `text` | Ride-level voucher (may mirror match vouchers) (unused)|

---

## `MatchRequests`

Peer requests between unmatched travelers.

| Column | Type | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| `id` | `uuid` | Primary key |
| `sender_id` | `uuid` | User who sent request |
| `receiver_id` | `uuid` | User who receives request |
| `sender_flight_id` | `bigint` | Sender’s `Flights.flight_id` |
| `receiver_flight_id` | `bigint` | Receiver’s `Flights.flight_id` |
| `status` | `text` | `pending`, `accepted`, or `rejected` |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | Request created |

Accepting calls RPC `accept_match_request`, which creates/updates `Matches` and marks flights matched.

## Auth schema

Supabase **`auth.users`** holds login identity (Google OAuth). **`public.Users`** is the app profile; created/updated on first sign-in via `/auth/callback`. Find more information on Supabase Authentication.
